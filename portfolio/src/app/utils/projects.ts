The project features both text-based and Swing GUI interfaces, enabling users to query real-time stock data through integrated API retrieval using AlphaVantageAPI. To enhance performance, we implemented a data caching mechanisms, allowing for more efficient API usage and improved query responsiveness. Built in collaboration with Ayomide Addey. Available on Github upon request.",

This project began with an understanding of the relationship between artists and generative AI. As an artist myself, I have experienced the frustration of generative AI being used to produce artwork through the exploitation of artists online. I wanted to restructure the relationship between artists and AI by providing an environment where this technology can uplift the creative process in a systemized manner, rather than rob from it.",
    process: "The current prototype supports primary workflows, such as logging in and signing up, creating a new workspace, saving generated resources to a profile, and exploring a page of publically available workspaces categorized by art form.  These workflows were visualized through both a hand-drawn and digital sitemap. These workflows were identified through benchmarking, as well as my own role as a user of these platforms. I identified the aspects of these UI's that I thought worked well, and ones that I did not want to bring into my own project.",
